2. I spent about hour and a half in total working on this class definition

3. I did not recieve any outside help

4. The overall program seeks to define a class that can be used by the file Simulation.py to create a sequence of balls that follows
   the physical laws of the simulated world. The first function that was defined in the code is the __init__ function. This function
   provides a blueprint for how the Ball class should be initialized when the constructor is called. The second and third functions are
   getVelocity functions. This type of function returns the current value for the velocity in the X and Y directions as velocity exists 
   in both directions. The next type of function is the getPostion functions. These functions return the X and Y coordinates for the 
   center of the ball. The last function that is defined is the advance function. This function is different from the others as it updates 
   the values of the velocity and the postion of the ball. This is need in order to progress the ball in simulated world.
