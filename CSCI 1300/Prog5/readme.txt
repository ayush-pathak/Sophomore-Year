3. I did recieve some help from Professor Goldwasser for the error checking in one of the functions

4. The overall program seeks to calculate the interest from user input values. The first part of the source code is the definitions
   of the functions. The first function is the greeting function which prints the overall flow of the program. The next function is
   the getRate function. This function takes a list of randomly generated integers as the interest rate options. The user then selects 
   the interest rate using a letter. The input is then checked to make sure that the input is valid. The next function is the getPrinciple
   function. This function, as the name suggests, is to get a principle value from the user. The user can enter anything at this point to 
   possibly crash the program, so it is necessary to check and make sure that the input is a valid non-negative dollar and cents input.
   The value does not need to contain a dollar sign as well. The next function is the computeBalance function, which performs the interest
   computation using the principle value and the interest rate. Another function that is in the source code is the results function.
   This function describes how the principle, interest rate, and balance are printed to the user. The last function described is the 
   askYesorNo function. This function is to determine if the user wants to perform another interest calculation. Again the user can input
   anything that they want. So when checking the input as a string, the only character that matters is the first one. If the user decides
   to do another calculation, the calculator will repromt a new set of rates and continue from there.
