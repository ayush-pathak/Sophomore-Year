2. I spent about 4 hours in total working on these mini projects.

3. I did receive some help from Professor Goldwasser for clarification of when to use return versus print statements.

4. The overall programs seek to take data from input files and return some output. For the gnome sequencing problem,
   the program takes the first number in the file and repeats over the range for that number. During this loop, the
   program checks to make sure if the sequence of 3 numbers are in either increasing or decreasing order. Depending on
   this result, the statment Ordered or Unordered is printed. The next assignment was the removal of consecutive duplicates.
   For this problem, the input is a series of strings. The first step is to remove the first number in the input and use that for
   making a condition for a while loop. The program then converts the strings into integers and compares them to each other. Then it 
   checks to make sure that if a number isn't included is added. The numbers are then printed. This continues until the first number is
   zero. The next problem was the Rock Paper Scissor counter. For the input, it is a series of R's S's and P's. Knowing that each player
   can only win in certain conditions, we can compare each value and if they meet those conditions, the win counter is advanced by one. 
   Until the input is E the program will continue. The final program was to calculate the speed of a car given the time and speed. 
   The data is taken out and variables are intialized. Then a for loop is made from the first number in the file. Then the next data are taken
   out and calculations are done with those numbers. The result is then printed to the screen.
