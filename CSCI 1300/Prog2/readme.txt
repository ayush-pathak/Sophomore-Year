2. I spent about 2 hours in total working on this 

3. I did not use any outside sources 

4. The overall program is taking the DNA sequence given by the user and finding a pattern give by the user in the DNA sequence.
   Then a temporary strand is created from the original strand after the end of the forward pattern. From the temporary strand,
   the reverse pattern is found. Then original DNA is split from the start of the forward pattern and the end of the reverse pattern.
   The split is then assign to a variable and reversed. The strings are then added together from the pieces and the inverted pair.
   The result is then printed to the screen.
