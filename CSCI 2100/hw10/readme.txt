Summary:

This program was designed to take in from the user the name of a compressed file.
The file is then opened and a binary tree is created using the first bit as the root.
The function called treeBuilder is called and the tree is then populated using recursive
calls. The next function called decodeMessage is called and the message is then decoded and 
written to a file using the tree that is built by the treeBuilder function.
