2. I spent about 4-5 hours in total working on this project

3. I did receive some help from Professor Goldwasser for intitalizing the irregular pattern of repetition of the checkers

4. The overall program is to ask the user to specify a unit size for a cell on the canvas. The program then creates a canvas that is 
   15 by 13 of the unit size. Then the background is created by a series of rectangles and oriented in the correct positions.
   Then the triangles are created by using the Polygon class and are oriented correctly by using a for loop and if statements to 
   set the correct fill colors. Within the triangles for loop, the numbers are added to the canvas using another for loop and
   offsetting for the extra triangles that hidden behind the middle rectangles. The checkers are then added by using a different for 
   loop and looping through a set of tuples. The multiple checkers are added by cloning the checkers multiple times as specified in the 
   tuple and added to the canvas. The result is then shown on the canvas.
