2. I spent about 30 minutes to 1 hour for about 2-3 days. So, it probably spent 2-3 hour in total working on this 

3. I did not use any outside sources 

4. The overall program is that there is a bird that flys into frame and lands on a tree and then is scared away by a bear that walks by. 
   I decided to make all the animals into layers as it makes it easier to move all the parts of the animal. 
   Furthermore I decided to make the reference point of the animal layers the approxiamte center of the animal in order to make the movements and rotations easier to determine. 
   Also, I made the sleep parameter as 0.25. This is because it makes the motion seem smoother and less jumpy than waiting longer and moving a larger distance across the canvas.
